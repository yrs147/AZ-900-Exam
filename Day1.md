# Cloud Computing
Practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and precess data , rather than a local server or a personal Computer.

| On Premise | Cloud Providers |
|--------------|---------------|
|You own the servers|Someone else own the servers|
|You hire IT people|Someone else hires the IT people |
|You pay or rent the real estate|Someone else pay or rent the real estate |
|You take all the risk|You are responsible for you configuring cloud services and code , someone else takes care of rest |

**Azure is a CSP (Cloud Service Provider)**

# Benefits of Cloud Computing

- **Cost Effective** : You pay for what you consume , no up-front cost . Pay-as-you-go(PAYG)
- **Global **: Launch workloads anywhere in world 
- **Secure** : Cloud Services are secure by default , also gives user the ability to configure access down to granular level.
- **Reliable**: data backup , diadter reecivery , and data replication , and fault tolerance 
- **Elastic **: Automate scaling during spikes and drop in demand 
- **Current** : The underlying hardware and managed software is patched , upgraded and replaces by the cloud provider without interruption to you.

# Types of Cloud Computing 

-  **Software as a Service**-  A product run and managed by the service provider. Eg - Salesforce , Gmail
-  **Platform as a Service**- Focus on the deployment of your apps.
- Example - Heroku , Elastic Beanstalk 
- **Infrastructure as a Service** -  The basic building blocks for cloud IT . provides access to networking features , computers and data storage space. Example - *Azure , AWS , Oracle Cloud*
